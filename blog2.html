        <p>Hypercars are a special breed of supercars known for their exceptional performance, cutting-edge technology,
            and eye-catching designs. These vehicles represent the pinnacle of automotive engineering and have captured
            the imaginations of car enthusiasts worldwide.</p>

        <p>The term "hypercar" is relatively new in the automotive industry and is often used to describe cars that go
            beyond traditional supercars in terms of performance, innovation, and exclusivity. While there is no strict
            definition of what constitutes a hypercar, these vehicles typically feature mind-blowing horsepower,
            lightweight construction, and advanced aerodynamics.</p>

        <h2>Early Hypercars</h2>

        <p>One of the earliest hypercars that gained widespread acclaim is the legendary McLaren F1. Launched in the
            early 1990s, the McLaren F1 redefined what was possible in a road car. With its carbon-fiber monocoque
            chassis, centrally-mounted driver's seat, and BMW-sourced V12 engine, the F1 set new speed records and
            became an instant icon.</p>

        <p>Another iconic hypercar from the same era is the Ferrari F40. Built to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary,
            the F40 was the last car personally approved by Enzo Ferrari himself. With its lightweight construction and
            twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the F40 was one of the fastest cars of its time and remains highly sought after
            by collectors.</p>

        <h2>Modern Hypercars</h2>

        <p>In recent years, hypercars have become even more extreme thanks to advances in technology and engineering.
            Leading the charge is the Bugatti Chiron, successor to the iconic Veyron. With its quad-turbocharged W16
            engine producing over 1,500 horsepower, the Chiron is capable of speeds exceeding 260 mph, making it one of
            the fastest production cars in the world.</p>

        <p>Another standout in the world of hypercars is the Koenigsegg Jesko. Named after the father of Koenigsegg
            founder Christian von Koenigsegg, the Jesko boasts a revolutionary new gearbox design that allows for
            lightning-fast gear changes. Combined with its twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing over 1,600 horsepower,
            the Jesko promises mind-bending performance on both the road and the track.</p>
