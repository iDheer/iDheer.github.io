        <h2>How have the beats been bangin' so far.</h2>
        <p>Hey, so I've been a music lover since childhood and I love to listen and rap to beats as it calms my brain
            and helps me to express what just couldn't have been possible without it. I don't consider myself a true
            audiophile but I rather have a taste of my own and it hasn't changed a lot in all these years. (Background -
